        # About
        This tool is written in **Ruby** using **RDiscount**'s implementation
        of **Markdown**.
        The slides are generated from a **Mustache** template.

        The next slide will introduce some formatting.
      notes: |
        Notes are optional. The next slide has no notes.

        ## Lists
        This is a simple *unordered* list:
        
        - one item;
        - another item;
        
        One can also create *ordered* lists:
        
        1. first item;
        1. second item.

        ## Blockquotes
        This is a famous passage by the English writer John Donne.
        It illustrates the use of blockquote.

        > No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the
        Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea,
        Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a
        Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes
        me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to
        know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.
