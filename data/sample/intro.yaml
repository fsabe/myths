        # Hello, World!
        This file demonstrates how this tool can be used to create a slide
        presentation.
        
        ## Controls
        - `<Space>`, `<Right>`, `<Down>` or `n` to go forward
        - `<Left>`, `<Up>` or `p` to go back
        - `q` to open the options menu
      notes: |
        Notes can be used to assist you in giving the presentation.

        # About
        This tool is written in **Ruby** using **RDiscount**'s implementation
        of **Markdown**.
        The slides are generated from a **Mustache** template.

        The next few slides will introduce some formatting.
      notes: |
        Notes are optional. The next slide has no notes.

        # Formatting
        ## Lists
        This is a simple *unordered* list:
        
        - one item;
        - another item;
        
        One can also create *ordered* lists:
        
        1. first item;
        1. second item.

        ## Blockquotes
        This is a famous passage by the English writer John Donne.
        It illustrates the use of blockquote.

        > No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the
        Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea,
        Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a
        Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes
        me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to
        know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

        ## Code blocks
        Here is some source code written in Haskell.
        It shows how a code block is formatted.

            isPrime :: Integer -> Bool
            isPrime x
                | x < 2 = False
                | otherwise = and
                    $ map ((/=) 0 . mod x)
                    $ takeWhile ((floor $ sqrt $ fromInteger x) >=) primes

            primes :: [Integer]
            primes = 2 : filter isPrime [3,5..]
