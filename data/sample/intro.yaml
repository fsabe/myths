        # About
        This tool is written in **Ruby** using **RDiscount**'s implementation
        of **Markdown**.
        The slides are generated from a **Mustache** template.

        The next slide will introduce some formatting.
      notes: |
        Notes are optional. The next slide has no notes.

        ## Lists
        This is a simple *unordered* list:
        
        - one item;
        - another item;
        
        One can also create *ordered* lists:
        
        1. first item;
        1. second item.
